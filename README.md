#Forking Workflow
An official repository which can be accessible to all the team members is created.
Forking means â€“ server side clone, means developers create their own repository that should be bare repository.
Then developers clone their own repository with the git clone command.
In local repository which is created by the developers, they can edit the code, commit the changes.
When developers commit their changes, they made accessible the code by pushing it to their public repository. Also, the developers request the project maintainer to merge their feature into official codebase.
When project maintainer get the pull request they look for the code and then integrate that into the official repository.
Other developers also synchronize with the official repository.
